# Verilog-Sin
Here is the digital signal generator of the Sin(x) function. The result is represented as a fixed-point number (32 bits and 25 decimal places) in direct code format. For implementation, the D10-nano board is used. The KEY0 button is used to reset, KEY1 is used to change the frequency, the direction input is used to change the frequency increment direction.
